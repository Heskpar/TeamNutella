front end test case: fillable text fields for login/register and that the button is responsive and will log in/create the user. Modify index.html for what page you want to test and form.spec.js for the test cases. Uses cypress from command line. call "npx serve" in one window and "npm run e2e" in another to run. This was the only test case we could think of from the front end side to automate. Other test cases could be conducted manually.
