## Testing 

### Front End

We automated the tests that check the functionality of the forms. Tests check fillable text fields for login and that the button is responsive and will log in the user.
1. Modify index.html for what page you want to test and form.spec.js for the test cases. 
2. Use cypress from command line. 
3. From one window 
```
$ npx serve
```
4. From another window 
```
$ npm run e2e
```
